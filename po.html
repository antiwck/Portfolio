					<td>Evaluation</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
 					<td>PO1</td>
					<td>1.00</td>
					<td>A full score demonstrates excellent utilization of engineering skills. It is essential to be able to apply the extracted knowledge from engineering subjects to ensure logical and impactful solutions to real-world problems.</td>
					<td>The score shows that various engineering problems were resolved using the appropriate knowledge extended from engineering subjects. However, there are areas for improvement such as applying knowledge onto real-world scenario outside academic environment. More hands-on experience could bridge the academic learning and application gap.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
 					<td>PO2</td>
					<td>0.88</td>
					<td>The moderate score shows that there are some deficiencies in analyzing problems applying engineering skills. The first step to solving engineering problems is to analyze the issue critically and take consideration of all the impacted aspects of the issues to make proper decisions on the appropriate engineering solution.</td>
					<td>The score shows that moderate analysis skills were applied to solve problems, however in-depth analysis is lacking. The necessity to have proper analysis is imperative to have ensure coverage on all possible cases for the best solution.</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
 					<td>PO3</td>
					<td>0.86</td>
					<td>The score shows that improvements can be made in the selection of tools whereby appropriate tools are used for the problems at hand.</td>
					<td>The score shows that wise choices for tools in engineering problems are made, however there are some cases where better tools can be used instead. This would require research on all available tools at disposal and critical analysis of their benefits and drawbacks for each to select the best tool possible.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
 					<td>PO4</td>
					<td>1.00</td>
					<td>A full score demonstrates a good selection of research techniques that have been used for engineering. Research techniques are imperative such that the topic related to engineering problems and for extrapolation potential solutions. </td>
					<td>Various techniques such as reading journals, watching tutorials, and hands-on experiments are great ways to research on a topic. However, there are a variety of techniques that may not be explored, hence continual learning and exploration should be carried out to stay up to date with industry practice.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
 					<td>PO5</td>
					<td>1.00</td>
					<td>A full score demonstrates the ability to innovate new solutions beyond the surface of engineering problems. Innovation is a necessity in engineering as new solutions that can replace old solutions with better improvements can have benefit to the industry and society. </td>
					<td>Designing engineering solutions or applications can be innovated in various forms, such as automating some of the processes or optimizing the design. It can be a challenging yet fulfilling task, but it requires exposure to new knowledge for inspiration.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
 					<td>PO6</td>
					<td>1.00</td>
					<td>A full score demonstrates the ability to articulate and convey professionally to recipients. Effective communication is an important aspect of engineering, as messages conveyed must be precise and accurate. </td>
					<td>Professional communication accounts for reducing misunderstanding, which eliminates potential conflicts in engineering environments. Communication channels such as Teams and Email are two useful tools to have effective communication, but face to face communication is a much better approach for it.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
 					<td>PO7</td>
					<td>1.00</td>
					<td>A full score demonstrates the ability to employ techniques to attain sustainability while ensuring minimal impact on the environment. </td>
					<td>Sustainability and environmental considerations are the responsibility of engineers when developing solutions, as the impact can be detrimental without careful planning. Although the outcome has been achieved, there are plenty of resources available in the industry for various applications, which can be explored for further improvement.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
 					<td>PO8</td>
					<td>1.00</td>
					<td>A full score shows the ability to develop solutions that adhere to the responsibility as an engineer.</td>
					<td>Safety, health, social, cultural and legal responsibility refers to the assimilation of the solutions, maintaining its ethical and social responsibility. Laws and regulations must be complied to demonstrate good engineering practices, however real-world applications will require more practical settings to carry out the responsibilities.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
 					<td>PO9</td>
					<td>0.80</td>
					<td>The score shows that improvements can be made to practice and account for responsibility. </td>
					<td>Accountability in the responsibility is an important subject as engineers must ensure that their development does not cause any damage, and even if it does, penalties must be borne. The score shows that there is room for improvement in executing the responsibility such as signing off tasks that have been assigned.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
 					<td>PO10</td>
					<td>1.00</td>
					<td>The score demonstrates effective cooperation with other engineers. Cooperation with other team members is important in engineering as every project requires collaboration.</td>
					<td>Although team collaboration is achieved, improvements on effective communication between different multi-disciplinary can be carried out to ensure the objectives are aligned.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
 					<td>PO11</td>
					<td>1.00</td>
					<td>The full score demonstrates proactivity and consistency in pursuing continuous improvement. </td>
					<td>Independent and lifelong learning are important to consistently upgrade oneself, the ability to do so ensures that any new industry trends can be applied. Although independent learning is evident, guided learning can also be equally beneficial, mentors that can provide insights is generally better for learning.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
 					<td>PO12</td>
					<td>1.00</td>
					<td>A full score demonstrates the ability to practice proper management skills in an organization to ensure the necessary skills to ensure organizational efficiency.</td>
					<td>The score reflects the capabilities to align responsibility with organizing tasks, time and financial management. However, other foundational skills such as managing people and high-stake projects must be obtained through real-world exposure. </td>
